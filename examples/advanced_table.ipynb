    "Test. Termime was the second most active participant in the digital café, leaving 44 comments, ten of which included the word history, with one further comment about the past (Termime referred to the past in a comment to the original posts 40, 73, 92, 104, 117 and 156, after a comment by Deadsaint, 159, after a comment by Thinkerer and Deadsaint, and 171, 178, 182 and 224, after a comment by Deadsaint. The most active citizen scientist in the digital café was Deadsaint, who left 91 comments. Termime also exchanged quite frequently with Thinkerer, who left 27 comments. Termime’s references to the past evolved in four stages throughout the digital café. She started with an appreciative comment on how she considered national borders and Italian nationalism to be intertwined. History was discussed in posts and comments before Termime decided to start to talk about history (see comment 33; defence - wars - 34; borders between historical periods as imaginary - 41; division / Berlin Wall - 65 geopolitical constructions - ‘as a history student I know this’ - 66; history affects perception on borders). Termime was prompted to refer to the past in a comment on post 40, which was a response to a post and an earlier comment submitted by Deadsaint:  "

I asked myself how the river could be a border and to whom the river belongs. The term border was untouchable for me. I saw the river, but I did not could understand what that river divided except two coats. Now, I can see that river like natural border between two countries divides language, culture, religion and law. But also, in my town I can see that borderland provides multinational and multicultural environment and that is advantageous. Growing up in a multinational and multicultural environment means that you do not see the strict boundaries between cultures, because they are somehow a compound of all cultures in that area. Over time, people assimilate and the boundaries between people disappeared, first and the foremost by the respecting of each other. | HammerTurkey | CS |\n",

And I've been to Berlin once, and I was very fortunate to see the wall, I found it a very moving experience, because I have always had a great love of history. | Gift | 196 | The Wall is an excellent example of a place divided. There are still Walls that divide - see the Middle East. They remind us that division is a permanent aspect of a Border. I am not condoning that, but it is something we must deal with.

    "| 65 | As a history student I'm more than interested in the phenomenon of borders, not only from the political aspect but from the cultural as well. Taking into consideration that I'm originally from Bosnia, that I was born in Croatia, but raised and educated in Serbia. When someone mention borders, firstly, I think about geopolitical lines that separate different countries. | Creator2 | 148 | I completely concord with this sentiment. I too feel that Borders ARE geopolitical constructs used to distinguish between separate lands. I suspect many other people hold a similar view; for example, the media and politicians. But whereas they see the Border as a gatepost for exclusion, which privileges some or others, I prefer the Border to be a signpost for a different land and culture. Something that can be celebrated for signifying difference in terrain, language, food, and culture. By embracing the different, we find out how much we have in common. | GamingScorpion | BS |\n",

    "| 66 | CS: I would like to summarize those things that affect someone's perception of borders as context, because, if we want to understand why someone thinks something or in some way about borders, we need to understand where he comes from, what time we are talking about. | LostFairy | 43 | As the author Neblett said \"We are the sum total of our experiences. Those experiences â€“ be they positive or negative â€“ make us the person we are, at any given point in our livesâ€ù.

    "| 68 | CS: There are several types of borders. If we start with the political ones, the first that defined them were the Mesopotamians and the Egyptians that had wars over these territories. Then, with time passing, there intervened other borders, let's call them interracial borders, language borders, and geographical and cultural borders. | SneakyWarthog | 66 | Political borders the way we think of it nowadays are deeply linked with the invention of nation states. The Treaty of Westphalia defined in 1648 sovereignty, that is the relationship between a power, a population and a territory. From that moment and with the help of progress in cartography, rulers were able to precisely define borders. Population census and identity card came later as new technology for controlling flows. We know examples of people on the Franco-Belgian border in the 19th century who took advantage of the imprecision of the border line for registering on the side which was the best for their personal or professional interest. I would argue that borders have hardly been more closed than in the modern society. | GrassPixie | BS |\n",

Having something that you care for that is just yours as in your Country makes you want to not give up and you feel close as ever to your fellow citizens.

    "| 92 | So I can say that political and culture borders are not the same thing because we have an example, not all people in Croatia are Croatians, not all people in Germany are Germans, of course. So we have many cultures in a land-national minority. | DreamBlackberry | 79 | I assume DreamBlackberry got the point. If I consider the border region where I am born and where I live, I notice that almost four different ethnies spread on both sides of the border which have been living together with no wall separating them. Moreover, I conceive this as a factor which enrich the cultural experience of a territory. | DeadSaint | CS |\n",

    "| 94 | CS: I do not know a lot about borders. I study anthropology and we had fieldwork in Prekmurje in Slovenia and we talked with people that live there close to the Hungarian border and we asked them how the border influenced them, the difference between the past and now, what changes borders brought. They said that borders influenced the past much more than now. | MoneyMobster | 65 | There are definitely strong debordering processes in the world, but we can also observe countermovement of rebordering processes. For example, the total length of borders in the world is increasing and some borders are building up fences. Look at the contradiction of crossing borders in a globalized world: a dead cow will easily cross every border as a steak for sell; but a human being with the wrong passport would not be allowed to travel. This applies even in the European Union with dramatic consequences.

    "| 137 | BS: I think I have a lot of experience just as a person in this world or as a professional. I also pick up on a kind of paradox that borders divide and unite. So on the one hand, there are different countries with their own laws and culture.

On the other hand, a border is an INVITATION to cross, it is a barrier. You have to deal with different customs. | Form | 42 | That is a very interesting point.

In this days the two countries emanated a special pass to nearly 400 families that were divided at the time of the Korean war that took place in the fifties so that the separated families could have a chance to see again the relatives that couldnt see each other for more than six decades. Do we need borders? I think that when we talk about different countries, cultures, religions borders are a good thing, because, within them, we as a country are able to be ourselves and just with the acceptance of the fact that we are different, we are truly able to comprehend the others and fully accept and embrace the difference between nations. And I also think that boundaries are a good thing, obviously to some extent. But then I came across at photos of divided families from North and South Corea or America and Mexico etc. and I ask myself what kind of borders do we really need? | Termime | CS |\n",
    "| 182 | CS1: Do we need borders? CS2: I think yes, without borders I think there would be chaos, because there are too many different people, I think, who can't live with each other, like with religions, because they are too different. I think we need borders for the same ethnic people who can stay in only one place not spread all around the word. | Aspect | 116 | However, if we think about the Berlin Wall or Middle East borders, we would notice that actually chaos ruled and rules over there | DeadSaint | CS |\n",
    "| 212 | BS: One small river between Poland and Silesia (Bystrica) was a border. In the 20th century it wasn't there anymore but nevertheless people felt divided. Polish people say: My daughter will never marry somebody from the other side. | CrashGoblin | 33 | This is a clear example of how much the territory where a community lives can affect the community itself. If there is a storical division between different populations which does not exist anymore, they should discuss about it | DeadSaint | CS |\n",

People there were told, since they were kids, that people from the other side are bad. To solve this problem, it would be necessary to change the way of thinking of the people. | ArchTauren | CS |\n",
    "| 224 | CS: Maybe you have an idea how to destroy mental borders between people? BS: I think one way to really help people to lower the border is to understand history BS: History is a really powerful way to eliminate or minimize such borders. | ShortSprite | 234 | Mmm actually I do not agree with you, because history can show the reason whay different start fighting. For example, in the area where I live there are two different ethnies living toghether whose relationships are improving with the passing of time, but if you studied history, you would see harsh fights which would remember to these people the reasons why they started hating each other. Concluding, I believe we should learn how to dialogue to minimise border between people | DeadSaint | CS |\n",

But I agree with both of you. I do not think that it is better to not consider history, regardless of how complicated and difficult it may be, because I believe that being aware of the past helps us shape the future. But then I understand DeadsSaints s point because It is not productive to be stuck in the past. In the end, dialogue and an open perspective are key. | Termime | CS |"
