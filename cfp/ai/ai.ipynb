    "Following the introduction of ChatGPT (2022), scholarly publications dealing with the human past, including history and memory studies, have undertaken examinations of generative AI's applications within these disciplines (<cite id=\"ft1br\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2F57JYGG4I\">(Kansteiner, 2022)</a></cite>). The *American Historical Review* dedicated a forum (<cite id=\"7c5ef\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2FT8GZWC6S\">(Meadows &#38; Sternfeld, 2023)</a></cite>) which highlights both the achievements of AI in history (particularly its ability to utilize large collections of primary sources) and the risks that this usage poses to historical research, primarily the reproduction of certain biases, notably but not exclusively those of gender and race. Thus, as the introduction to this forum reminds us: 'To ponder the effects of artificial intelligence on the field of history quite often requires interrogating fundamental concepts such as truth, evidence, and authenticity.'  In a similar vein, *Memory Studies Review* dedicated a special issue to investigating the implications of generative platforms for collective memory formation and evolution (<cite id=\"luval\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2FXL4ALY7K\">(Gensburger &#38; Clavert, 2024)</a></cite>). Holocaust studies scholars are investigating which narrative chatbots based on AI are putting forward (<cite id=\"3pwqc\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2FLDXY7FTY\">(Makhortykh, 2023)</a></cite>). Significant discourse has emerged regarding AI implementation in archival institutions confronting exponentially increasing document volumes (<cite id=\"m8ncm\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2F37XEGU7W\">(Jaillant &#38; Caputo, 2022)</a></cite>). Photographic archives, presenting distinct methodological considerations, have garnered particular scholarly attention (<cite id=\"ep75g\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2F9KV326BZ\">(Dentler et al., 2024)</a></cite>; <cite id=\"sdhs8\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2FWHBCNYE6\">(Arnold &#38; Tilton, 2023)</a></cite>). Digital historians are currently trying to figure out what AI 'knows' about the past (<cite id=\"5lqel\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2FYQ73A8EF\">(Hutchinson, 2022)</a></cite>). Furthermore, generative AI holds the potential to fundamentally transform routine historical methodologies (<cite id=\"tkab7\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C4583%2FRAASRNCB\">(Clavert &#38; Muller, 2024)</a></cite>), independent of major digital history initiatives. This proliferation of AI within historical and other past-related scholarship portends substantial modifications to methodology."

      "abstract": "Co-authored by a Computer Scientist and a Digital Humanist, this article examines the challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions in the digital age, which have led to the closure of the vast majority of born-digital archival collections. It focuses particularly on cultural organizations such as libraries, museums and archives, used by historians, literary scholars and other Humanities scholars. Most born-digital records held by cultural organizations are inaccessible due to privacy, copyright, commercial and technical issues. Even when born-digital data are publicly available (as in the case of web archives), users often need to physically travel to repositories such as the British Library or the Bibliothèque Nationale de France to consult web pages. Provided with enough sample data from which to learn and train their models, AI, and more specifically machine learning algorithms, offer the opportunity to improve and ease the access to digital archives by learning to perform complex human tasks. These vary from providing intelligent support for searching the archives to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks. In this article, we focus on sensitivity review as a practical solution to unlock digital archives that would allow archival institutions to make non-sensitive information available. This promise to make archives more accessible does not come free of warnings for potential pitfalls and risks: inherent errors, \"black box\" approaches that make the algorithm inscrutable, and risks related to bias, fake, or partial information. Our central argument is that AI can deliver its promise to make digital archival collections more accessible, but it also creates new challenges - particularly in terms of ethics. In the conclusion, we insist on the importance of fairness, accountability and transparency in the process of making digital archives more accessible.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is making history, literally. Machine learning tools are playing a key role in crafting images and stories about the past in popular culture. AI has probably also already invaded the history classroom. Large language models such as GPT-3 are able to generate compelling, non-plagiarized texts in response to simple natural language inputs, thus providing students with an opportunity to produce high-quality written assignments with minimum effort. In a similar vein, tools like GPT-3 are likely to revolutionize historical studies, enabling historians and other professionals who deal in texts to rely on AIgenerated intermediate work products, such as accurate translations, summaries, and chronologies. But present-day large language models fail at key tasks that historians hold in high regard. They are structurally incapable of telling the truth and tracking pieces of information through layers of texts. What's more, they lack ethical self-reflexivity. Therefore, for the time being, the writing of academic history will require human agency. But for historical theorists, large language models might offer an opportunity to test basic hypotheses about the nature of historical writing. Historical theorists can, for instance, have customized large language models write a series of descriptive, narrative, and assertive histories about the same events, thereby enabling them to explore the precise relation between description, narration, and argumentation in historical writing. In short, with specifically designed large language models, historical theorists can run the kinds of largescale writing experiments that they could never put into practice with real historians.",

However, much of the most sensitive material from these collections remains undigitized or difficult to discover and use. More recently, a critical reconsideration of open digital access has also taken place, particularly when it comes to sensitive material from the colonial archive. Collectively, this has created a situation in which the colonial photography archive risks becoming overly sanitized as well as difficult to navigate and analyze.",

      "abstract": "This AHR History Lab forum brings together scholars and practitioners from within and outside the historical discipline to consider the methodological and epistemological implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on historical practice. It is our hope that the following short essays will be the first of many such conversations on this immense topic in these pages. In conceiving of this interdisciplinary forum, our goal was less to provide an introductory primer on artificial intelligence for historians than to allow the participants ample room to interpret what they consider the relevant issues connecting artificial intelligence with history.",

In the one hand, the emergence of generative\n              ai\n              , exemplified by ChatGPT’s 2022 release, appears to herald a new infrastructure for collective memory. On the other, the memory studies work highlights the limits and the backlashes of this new form of memory in its social dimension. This leads to raise a provocative, open-ended question: Is artificial intelligence the future of collective memory? Our issue brings together diverse perspectives from memory studies scholars of different backgrounds and machine learning practitioners, fostering critical engagement with\n              ai\n              in memory practices. This multidisciplinary approach offers an initial exploration of the interactions between\n              ai\n              -powered software, platforms, and collective memory. The articles herein present a multifaceted analysis of\n              ai\n              ’s role in shaping collective memory’s future. We advocate for increased interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical reflection in this rapidly evolving domain, providing memory studies scholars with a foundation for understanding and engaging with these technological transformations.",
