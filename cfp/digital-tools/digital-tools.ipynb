    "In the field of digital history, there exists a rapidly increasing range of digital tools to study the past. Online, a number of websites feature lists of DH-tools, using well-known applications such as Jupyter notebooks, Zotero, and Scalar—as well as a wide range of data visualization scripts, geographic mapping software, and timeline tools. Furthermore, digital historians are developing specialized digital toolboxes that draw inspiration from major platform strategies for managing digital collections and explore techniques for analyzing digital source materials using artificial intelligence and machine learning."

    "This special issue of the Journal of Digital History welcomes contributions that introduce and discuss digital toolkits for exploring historic source materials, be they sonic, textual, visual, or audiovisual. We seek to collect a broad range of publications that demonstrate and critically analyse new ways of exploring the past through computational means and strive to open up and problematize the use of digital methods in historic research.

    "In line with the journal’s publication standards, the toolkits should be open source and the articles available in Jupyter Notebooks. Preferably, datasets used should also be open and available for being uploaded on the journal’s website. We especially welcome contributions that take advantage of the journal’s multi-layered structure for narrating and commenting on code, including analytical reflections on the possibilities and limitations of the analytical tools used. We also invite proposals for methods that combine multiple media modalities—from 3D to text, sound, and moving images. Finally, we encourage contributions that provide critical reflections on the role of digital tools in producing new (historic) knowledge, and/or strive to historize the use of digital methods among historians."

    "Authors should locate proposed submissions in a broader methodological and/or historical context and express a pedagogic interest in explaining, illustrating, and untangling the functionality of the proposed methods. The digital tools do not have to be fully programmed by the authors themselves—extending and reusing existing open-source code is naturally acceptable. However, the particular assemblage of code and scripts in the toolkits should be unique and display a novel level of complexity, with a scientific and/or methodological contextualization."

    "- Textual, visual, audiovisual and/or sonic toolkits for exploring historic source materials, including discussions on the challenges and opportunities that such tools bring with them.\n",
    "- New methods of using AI and machine learning to analyze, annotate or extract information from historic sources, including techniques such as natural language processing, speech to text, facial/object detection, etc.\n",
    "- Toolkits that aim at preparing, organizing, and curating datasets.\n",

    "- Comparative investigations of the technical workings of different methods for analyzing digitized historic sources.\n",
